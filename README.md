Plist Editor is an application capable of modifying application name, version, display name, bundle ID, minimum OS version, and it can automatically save a new plist file in iOS files. Unfortunately, currently, you need to manually unzip the IPA and save the .plist file in files, then edit it with this app. Although it might not seem worthwhile, as other apps like Filza or eSign can perform similar tasks, this app will soon receive an update. The upcoming update will automate the process of unzipping, zipping the .IPA file, rebuilding it, and saving it in files, eliminating the need for manual intervention. However, this functionality is not possible at the moment due to various reasons. Stay tuned for the upcoming ðŸ”¥ update.
